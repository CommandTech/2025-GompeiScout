2024 Scouting Code Redone from scratch.
Rewritten to help make it easier for new users to understand, modify, and use.


Wants:

- [ ] Modular design (Code that doesn't change stays in a folder that doesn't get touched. Code that changes every year is in a different folder.)

- [x] See if you can overlay different screens on top of each other

- [x] Make a way to refresh the amount of controllers connected while running. (Either always looking or a button on the screen to look)

- [x] Make the API key in 1 spot in the entire code

- [x] Have a save/load option (Try out ini files)

- [ ] Event checklist screen (Not having to load excess events that you don't care about)

- [ ] Possibly remove sql (export to a txt or something excel can read)

- [x] Select where controllers are located in base program (the addon made in 2024 but better and designed from the start)

- [ ] Modular data interface (be able to see what other teams also are looking at for data)

- [ ] Alliance selection stuff (show the strengths of each alliance during alliance selection and hide teams that have been selected already)

- [ ] Training mode or interface with sound cues

- [ ] Paper scouting and drive team notes that only show up for our team
